          <h3>Introduction to Video Games</h3>
          <ul>

              <li>My love for video games began from a young age, when I would visit my friend's house and we would play together for hours.</li> 
              <li>My parents were always conservative about allowing me a lot of time to play games, as they thought it would deter me from my studies. </li>
              <li>Ironically, I'm making my career around video games now, which is honestly pretty funny. </li>

              <li>To understand the meaning behind the art that is writing, the different forms of portraying your ideas and the various ways that media expands, all of it, is fascinating. </li>

              <li>I also love to see different philosophies and ideologies, understand their meanings.</li>

          <h3>Creative Writing</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>Since my interest in media has been huge ever since I was a little kid, I used to love to write fictional stories, or spin offs based off of shows I liked.</li>
              <li>My thoughts are always racing, and I'm always trying to come up with new ideas.</li>
              <li>One day, I wish to write my own video game, from the characters to the story. It is a sort of a dream project of mine.</li>
              <li>For this, I'm planning to minor in creative writing to improve my writing as well as to help me get closer to achieving that dream.</li>
