          <h3>Introduction to Video Games</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>I love to indulge in new experiences. I love to understand about the world, things I take an interest in, and to explore and learn.</li> 
              <li>My love for video games began from a young age, when I would visit my friend's house and we would play video games together for hours.</li> 
              <li>My parents were always conservative about allowing to play games, as they thought it would deter me from my studies. They looked at it like a distraction.</li>
              <li>Ironically, I'm trying to make a career around video games now. </li>
              <li>Video games were an escape from reality for me, as they let me immerse myself into this world separate from us, which was therapeutic for me.</li>
              <li></li>
          </ul>

          <h3> Introduction to Other Forms of Media</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>My passion for video games, drifted into other mediums of entertainment, ranging from cartoons, anime, movies, series and to some extent books. </li>
              <li>I'd love to get lost in these fictional as well as non-fictional worlds. </li>
              <li>To understand the meaning behind the art that is writing, the different forms of portraying your ideas and the various ways that media expands, all of it, is fascinating. </li>
              <li>Furthermore, to experience the stories and understand the characters in depth, makes me genuinely feel at peace. </li>
          </ul>

      <section id = "psych">
          <h3>Psychology and Philosophy</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>All interest in understanding characters and the layers behind stories, made me super interested in subjects like psychology and philosophy. </li>
              <li>This goes to the extent that I'm considering majoring in Psychology to better enhance my knowledge on the subject.</li>
              <li>I also love to see different philosophies and ideologies, understand their meanings.</li>
              <li>Both of these interests, help me understand characters and stories better.</li>
          </ul>
      </section>

      <section id = "writing">
          <h3>Creative Writing</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>Since my interest in media has been huge ever since I was a little kid, I used to love to write fictional stories, or spin offs based off of shows I liked.</li>
              <li>My thoughts are always racing, and I'm always trying to come up with new ideas.</li>
              <li>One day, I wish to write my own video game, from the characters to the story. It is a sort of a dream project of mine.</li>
              <li>For this, I'm planning to minor in creative writing to improve my writing as well as to help me get closer to achieving that dream.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Other Skills</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>I've always thought of myself to be a very expressive person as well as a good leader. </li>
              <li>I like to get involved in stuff that I care about, and always seek to be the best I can be and give my maximum output.</li>
              <li>I used to be a part of the Student Government back in high school and I currently am an Executive Board member in OASIS, a club that represents students from the Indian subcontinent.</li>
