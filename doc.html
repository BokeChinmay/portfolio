            Personal Portfolio.
        </h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Follow the layout.</li>
                <li>Header will include my profile photo and a heading.</li>
                <li>The 3 image pieces on the layout will be my projects and details about them along with a snippet of the project as an image.</li>
                <li>The review section will be altered into a contact info section and will be made a little smaller in size.</li>
                <li>Thinking of changing background color (black probably) though, don't want it to be white.</li>
                <li>Implementing fonts that suit my style, text color will probably be white.</li>
                <li>I don't know if there should be navigation/menu bars on the page, since its not too massive, 
                    but it would be kind of a good addition if I can find a way to implement it, so thoughts on that?</li>
                <li>The only place I can think where that could fit is the sub-heading (in reference to the layout reference)</li>
                <li>Added a nav bar using bootstrap</li>
                <li>Also used fontawesome</li>
                <li>Added a personal favicon</li>
                <li>Color scheme is pretty good, added personal info and an additional about me page.</li>
            </ul>
